			<p>
				As an undergraduate student, I had a passion for learning about how cultural values impacted political laws and sanctions.
				Growing up Korean American in Singapore, my entire life has been a concoction of different customs, which is why I love traveling. 
				The natural and architectural scenery has inspired the axiom of my life, creating a bountiful of relationships from people all over
				the world. I believe my multi-cultural and academic background is the perfect opportunity to understand and appreciate culture.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of the countries that I have traveled are: Italy, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, etc. and they are just a start to my neverending love for travel. 
				The art and fashion of each scenery are an inspiration to all aspects of vivality. It screams of joy and color waiting for the right person to appreciate their values
				which starts with you. I believe everyone should take the iniative to explore the nooks and crannies of each continent as a way to to animate their life.

				If you wish to contact me for any advices on travel plans, need my opinion for places to visit, etc.  check out google. 
				It's always the best place to search up places :)
